# Sandwich Club Project Starter Code

## Description
App displays a scrollable list of a variety of sandwiches. 
Tapping each sandwich would navigate you to access further details of the sandwich.  

## Motivation
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project helped me develop a better understanding 
of the process in the background when external libraries are actually applied. 

The intensive Nanodegree in Android Developer by Google on Udacity ensured that this project did not involve the use of external libraries.
